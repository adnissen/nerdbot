--------
These are custom modules I've written for sevabot (a skype bot written in python). Feel free to use / improve them. 

#modules
--------
**insult.py** -- gets an insult from adnissen.com/insults

**isearch.py** -- returns a mebe.co link to the search term

**r.py** -- remembers anything for any key (read the source, it'll make sense). uploads them to Parse so that a restart / crash / whatever won't delete the data.

**ts.py** -- searches for a tweet

**tweet.py** -- gets a tweet from adnissen.com/tweets

**y.py** -- youtube search. returns the title and a link to the top result.
